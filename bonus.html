        <h3> Blue Karnilla</h3>
        <p>
            The birth and early life of Karnilla were shrouded in mystery. All that was really known is that she had long lived in Nornheim, the Asgardian province where the Three Norns dwelt,
             the goddesses of destiny, and she became one of the most accomplished practitioners of the arts of sorcery in the Asgardian dimension. Although Nornheim lay on the Asgardian landmass within Asgard's own dimension, and although Karnilla was apparently of the Asgardian race, 
            she did not consider herself to be subject to Asgardian rule. Rather, Nornheim was an independent country, of which Karnilla was absolute monarch.
